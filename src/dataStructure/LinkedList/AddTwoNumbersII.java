/**
 *  * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
 *  The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. 
 *  Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

   You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 * 此题有两种解法：                                                                                                           Time complexity            Space complexity
 *  1) reverse list + add two numbers             O(m+n)					O(1)
 *  2) stack + add two numbers					  O(m+n)					O(m+n)
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.
 *     Using solution#2 with stack will not modify the input lists.
