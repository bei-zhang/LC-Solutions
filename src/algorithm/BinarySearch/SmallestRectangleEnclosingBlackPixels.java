/**
 * An image is represented by a binary matrix with 0 as a white pixel and 1 as a
 * black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black
 * region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location
 * (x, y) of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest
 * (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.
